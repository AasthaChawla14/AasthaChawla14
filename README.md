- I am a graduate student currently pursuing Operations Research at UT Austin.
- Additionally, I am working with Dell Technologies as a Data Science Intern.
- Before my graduate program, I worked at American Express as a Senior Business Analyst for 3 years in Finance Data Science and Enterprise Digital Analytics Team.
- I am looking for full time job opportunities in  United States and I am open to Data Scientist/Data Analyst/Consultant/Product Manager/Business Intelligence roles. If you have anything for me, please reach out through my contact information below.
- My goal is to leverage my skills and experience in data science to contribute to cutting-edge AI and ML projects and drive meaningful advancements in the field. I also like to challenge myself and evolve as the new Technologies come in place.
